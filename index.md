# Introduction

Welcome to the course...

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Files Description

- `_config.yaml` is it used to specify the ARCA githubpages template
- `index.md` is the file used to create the home page. In the header you can specify metadata:
    
    ```
    ---
    course_title: Welcome to ARCA Course
    author_name: Author Name
    ---
    ```

## Link to Ohter Files

You can add any file, html pages, or other relevent material and create a link to them. 

> Note that Jekyll will automatically create an html page for each `.md` file.
>
> For example `[link](trial-page.html)` will link to the `trial-page.html` produced by `trial-page.md` file available at the root.
> 
> Click the [link](trial-page.html) to check.

### Not in TOC

# Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ClaudioZandonella/Template-ARCA-Course/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
